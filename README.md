This is a voxel based game I've started a while ago.
It implements:

- A fully functional chunk system
- Culling of interior faces
- Greedy mesh algorithm (https://0fps.net/2012/06/30/meshing-in-a-minecraft-game/)
- A qbt loader, which is the file format generated but qbicle: http://www.minddesk.com/
- A beautiful inventory
- A start menu
- A world creation and selection menu
- A player with animations
- A 3rd person camera with care of walls
- And probably more stuff
